Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `lumi`, state `jumping`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 5 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure green #00FF00. Treat the row as 5 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 原原创的露米：黑蓝短发、青绿色大眼、左侧星形发饰、象牙白短披肩裙和薄荷色镶边；Q版全身小精灵，保留清晰脸部和细小四肢。透明悬浮宠物，最终没有背景、地面阴影、卡片、边框、光环、飘散粒子。. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: 精致清晰的Q版动画游戏宠物，紧凑全身轮廓，细节适合192x208像素单格.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
